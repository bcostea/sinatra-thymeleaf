# sinatra-thymeleaf
Sinatra template support for Thymeleaf.rb

# Thymeleaf.rb
Thymeleaf.rb is a Ruby adaptation of Thymeleaf, a natural templating engine.

It allows to create natural templates (HTML that can be correctly displayed in browsers and also work as static prototypes) and render with a data set to provide them functionality.

You can find Thymeleaf.rb here: https://github.com/trabe/thymeleaf-rb
Templating language is here: http://www.thymeleaf.org

# Usage

This is a gem so just pop it in your Gemfile:

```
gem 'thymeleaf'
```

Then, require it and activate the helper in your app:
```
require 'sinatra/base'
require 'sinatra-thymeleaf'

class App < Sinatra::Base
  helpers Sinatra::Thymeleaf
  
    get "/test" do
        thyme :test
    end
end
```

The views have an html externsion and should be placed in the views directory.
That's about it. 

I'll continue to add functionality and details, as I'm looking to use this in a project.
Please add issues if you spot any problems.
